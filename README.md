# Graphify

This repository provides implementations of fundamental graph algorithms in Java. These algorithms are useful for various graph-related problems in computer science and network analysis.

### Algorithms Included:

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm: 
Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.
#### Breadth-First Search (BFS): 
Explores a graph systematically, visiting all the neighbors of the current node before moving to the next level of neighbors.
#### Topological Sort: 
Orders the nodes of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge from node u to node v, u appears before v in the ordering.
#### Bipartite Graph Checking: 
Determines if a graph can be colored using only two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.
